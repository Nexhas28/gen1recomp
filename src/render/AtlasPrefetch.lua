-- Background pre-bake of RED++ tileset atlases (see TileRenderer's
-- getGbcAtlas, src/render/AtlasBake.lua, src/render/atlas_worker.lua).
--
-- A map's first TileRenderer under COLORS = RED++ recolors its whole atlas
-- pixel by pixel.  Done inside a seam crossing or a warp that is a visible
-- hitch on a handheld, so the overworld asks for the atlases it is about to
-- need (the maps one crossing away, a warp's destination) and the worker bakes
-- them ahead of time.  The finished ImageData waits in a bounded "ready" store
-- until getGbcAtlas turns it into an Image (newImage stays on the main thread,
-- lazily, so draining costs no GPU work).  A request that has not finished by
-- the time its map is built is simply baked synchronously as it always was,
-- and the late result is then dropped because the slot is filled.
--
-- Without love.thread, with POKEPORT_NO_THREAD=1, or if the worker fails to
-- start or dies, request() is a no-op and nothing changes.
--
-- The worker, queues, epochs and stores come from src/core/WorkerLane.lua.
-- Two lanes share the one atlas worker, each with its own queues and
-- in-flight budget so a bake never sits behind a long run of decodes (each is
-- a short job) and vice versa:
--   bakes    RED++ atlas recolours (palette dependent)
--   decodes  image FILE decodes (Assets.image / Assets.imageData read the
--            result; palette independent)
-- Every request is a closure / path that builds its payload only when it is
-- sent, so queued hints cost nothing until their turn.
